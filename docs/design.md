Perf-taint consists of two major software components: an LLVM pass used for extended taint
instrumentation, and a runtime library linked to the resulting application to supply the necessary
helper functions for tainting.

## LLVM Pass

FIXME

## Runtime library

FIXME

In future, we are planning to replace the current implementation with a more efficent one that
generates a JSON offline.
